# How Edabit Works

`Language Fundamentals` `Strings`

---

This is an introduction to how challenges on Edabit work. In the **Code tab above** you'll see a starter function that looks like this:

```
function hello() {

}
```

All you have to do is type `return "hello edabit.com" ` between the curly braces `{ }` and then click the **Check** button. If you did this correctly, the button will turn red and say **SUBMIT FINAL**. Click it and see what happens.

### **Notes**

- The returned string must be in **all lowercase** letters.
- If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the **Resources** tab.
- If you're _really_ stuck, unlock solutions in the **Solutions** tab.
